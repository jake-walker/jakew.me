Recently I bought a cheap TFT display for a project I was doing (which I'll write up in the future). I finally decided upon the [1.8" 128x160 ST7735 Display](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/282469570479) from [Karen's eShop](https://www.ebay.co.uk/usr/karens_e-shop) on eBay. She actually asked me to write up how I got my display working on a Raspberry Pi. Her shop is UK based and has lots of great electronics modules for Arduinos and Raspberry Pis.

On the product page, the seller has got **very** detailed instructions on how to get it working on an Arduino which is great because many sellers don't include any information to get it working.

# Wiring

This [useful site](https://pinout.xyz/) might be useful for identifying where pins are on your Raspberry Pi.

| Screen | Raspberry Pi |
| ------ | ------------ |
| GND    | *Any Ground* |
| VCC    | *Any 5v Power* |
| SCL    | BCM 11 |
| SDA    | BCM 10 |
| RES    | BCM 25 |
| DC     | BCM 24 |
| CS     | BCM 8 |
| BL     | **Don't connect** but does seem to make the screen brighter if connected to 5v |

# Software

I found a [library](https://github.com/cskau/Python_ST7735) for the screens using the ST7735 chip on GitHub by [cskau](https://github.com/cskau). It is a modified version of a library Adafruit uses for some of their screens. The instructions on the GitHub page are for Python 2 and the ones I've written here are for Python 3.

Firstly, start off by downloading some things required for the library to work:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential python3-dev python3-smbus python3-pip python3-imaging python3-numpy git
```

Next you'll need to install the Raspberry Pi GPIO and Adafruit GPIO libraries for Python:

```bash
sudo python3 -m pip install RPi.GPIO
sudo python3 -m pip install Adafruit_GPIO
```

Afterwards you can clone the repository and install the library:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cskau/Python_ST7735
cd Python_ST7735
sudo python3 setup.py install
```

Then you can try out some of the examples in the `Python_ST7735/examples` folder, but the screen I had was smaller than what was on the examples so there were multi-coloured pixels around the edge of the screen which I guess is noise?

Here's what code I had to write which sets the screen size correctly for the screen I bought:

```python
from PIL import Image
from PIL import ImageDraw
from PIL import ImageFont
import ST7735 as TFT
import Adafruit_GPIO.SPI as SPI

# Make the following 2 numbers bigger if you have multi-coloured pixels around the edge of the screen.
WIDTH = 128 # I used 130
HEIGHT = 160 # I used 161
SPEED_HZ = 4000000

# The pins of where we wired the DC and RES pins.
DC = 24
RST = 25
SPI_PORT = 0
SPI_DEVICE = 0

# Create a TFT screen object.
disp = TFT.ST7735(
    DC,
    rst=RST,
    spi=SPI.SpiDev(
        SPI_PORT,
        SPI_DEVICE,
        max_speed_hz=SPEED_HZ),
    width=WIDTH,
    height=HEIGHT)

# Start up the display.
disp.begin()
disp.clear()

# Create a new PIL image to draw to.
image = Image.new("RGB", (WIDTH, HEIGHT))
draw = ImageDraw.Draw(image)
width, height = image.size

# Add PIL drawing commands here
# . . .

disp.display(image)
```

For some reason the screen size in the code is bigger than the actual screen size which is in the eBay listing. I had to edit these quite a bit for the multi-coloured pixels to disappear so you might have to as well.
