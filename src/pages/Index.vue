        Hi! I'm Jake Walker, a Developer and Tech Enthusiast living in the United Kingdom.

      <p>
        When I was around 7 years old, I started programming, starting off with
        the <a class="no-underline hover:underline text-primary" href="http://smallbasic.com/">Small Basic</a> programming
        language. Ever since I have been refining my programming skills by
        learning more complex languages and by creating small applications,
        websites and more. In 2015, I started
        <a class="no-underline hover:underline text-primary" href="https://github.com/jake-walker">my GitHub account</a> and
        began to contribute to open source software and published some of my
        own projects.
