# About

Hey! I'm Jake, and I'm a Site Reliability Engineer from the United Kingdom. In my spare time I enjoy playing with new tech, learning new things and occasionally coding. I like to share what I learn here.

When I was young, I was lucky enough to have a computer where I learnt to program and as well as learn other computing skills. Ever since, I have been refining my programming skills by learning more complex languages and creating small applications, websites and more. In high school and sixth form I was able to get involved with lots of new opportunities in computing and started a GitHub account where I publish some of my projects as well as trying to contribute to open source software.

In 2020 I started an apprenticeship in Cyber Security and started my career in tech.
