    Hi! I'm Jake Walker, a Full Stack Developer and Tech Enthusiast living in
    the United Kingdom.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I was around 7 years old, I started programming, starting off with the
    <a href="http://smallbasic.com/">Small Basic</a> programming language. Ever since
    I have been refining my programming skills by learning more complex languages
    and by creating small applications, websites and more. In 2015, I started
    <a href="https://github.com/jake-walker">my GitHub account</a> and began to
    contribute to open source software and published some of my own projects.
