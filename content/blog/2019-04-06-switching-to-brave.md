description: "My experience of switching to the Brave Web Browser."

I wouldn't normally make a post about switching web browsers. I've switched browsers many times in the past and never made a big deal of it, but [Brave](https://brave.com/) is different.

I first heard about [Brave](https://brave.com/) a few months after it came out on the 20th January 2016 and I thought that the built-in Ad blocking feature was pretty cool, so I tried it for a day or so.

The initial version of Brave, was a little basic, for me at least, not having extension support (which was a must as I use a password manager) and generally just an early build version, not meant for daily use. I ended up not switching over to Brave after all, and I ended up forgetting about Brave.

Fast-forward to April 2019, where I see one of my friends using it. I instantly knew that I had to try it again now that it's been polished up. I load up the Brave Website and see the biggest text on my screen: "You are not a product".

And those 5 words made me want to switch to Brave, even before installing it. When I do install it though, I love the experience.

# The Brave Browser

Brave is a free and open source web browser which is based on Chromium (essentially an open source version of the Chrome browser). Brave blocks ads and website trackers by default.

One of Brave's biggest features for me is that it has a [BAT](https://basicattentiontoken.org/) cryptocurrency wallet built-in. [BAT (or Basic Attention Token)](https://basicattentiontoken.org/) is a cryptocurrency made by Brave which is exchanged between publishers, advertisers and users. Advertisers pay Brave to serve their Ads on the Brave platform. Brave pays 15% of the revenue to publishers and content creators.

What about the remaining 85%? Well Brave keeps 15% of revenue and actually pays the remaining 70% to the user. This is what I think makes Brave so different from other browsers, users are actually getting paid for the advertisements that they view.

This seems great for Brave users, but not so great for publishers and content creators, but Brave has also thought of this and made it so that you can easily pay your DAT to your favourite websites on a monthly basis. I have this setup on my website and didn't take any effort to get setup.

If you decide to give a 'tip' to a website, you'll get a little pop-up which looks something like this.

And this pop-up lets users decide how much they would like to tip and whether they would like to tip every month or not. This lets users securely and anonymously give back to creators, which I would assume will be more profitable for creators than with traditional advertising.

It's worth pointing out though, if this doesn't sound like your cup of tea, you actually don't have to opt into this in the first place. Yes, that's right, you have to opt-in to getting these replacement Ads.

This is the main reason I wanted to make this post, to point out the vision of Brave to make the internet a better place. Brave wants to stop the abuse of users by being tracked all the time across website and dodgy, misleading Ads.

While this all might seem like a crazy, controversial idea, I really think that BAT or something like it could take off and make the internet a bit of a better place. Maybe one day we'll have BAT as a universal internet currency, letting us buy a Netflix subscription for 20 BAT per month.

I don't like Ads or trackers at all, so I don't put them on my site at all. If you enjoyed this article and you want to support me and don't use Brave already, you can download Brave using [my referral link (https://brave.com/jak580)](https://brave.com/jak580) and use it regularly for 30 days (which will give me $5 in BAT). And if you already have Brave I'd love it if you could give me a tip by clicking on the triangle in the URL bar.
