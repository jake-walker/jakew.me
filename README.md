Hey! This is the source code for my website at <https://jakew.me>. It is powered the [Astro](https://astro.build/) web framework and uses [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) as a headless CMS.

## Development

I use pnpm for this project, but any corepack package manager should work too.

To get started, run `pnpm install` to grab all the dependencies. Then, run `pnpm dev` to start a local development server.
