# jakew.me

This is the source code for my site at <https://jakew.me>! My site contains a blog alogn with social links and other things.

This site is created using the [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) static site generator, along with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) CSS framework for styling. I host my site on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Development

To setup an environment for editing this site, you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

1. Install the Gatsby CLI with `yarn global add gatsby` or `npm install --global gatsby`.
2. Run `yarn install` or `npm install` to install the project's dependencies.
3. Run `gatsby develop` to run a live-reloading development server.
4. Run `gatsby build` to build a production version of the website for deployment.
