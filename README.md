# Jake Walker

This is the source code for my website at <https://jakew.me>! My website contains a blog along with social links and other things.

This site is created using the [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/) static site generator, along with [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) CSS framework for styling and host my site on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Development

To setup an environment for editing this site, you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

1. Install Gridsome CLI with `yarn global add @gridsome/cli` or `npm install --global @gridsome/cli`.
2. Run `yarn develop` to start a live reloading development server.

## Contributing

Although I only have content on my site that I have written myself, feel free to open an issue or pull request with a mistake that I've made and I'll make sure you get the credit.
